## Activity 3: Let's test our workflow!

**Steps:**

1. In the AWS Step Functions console, click **State machines** in the top, right-hand corner of the screen.
2. Click on the **reinvent-etl-inference-workflow** state machine 
3. Click **Start execution**
4. Paste the following json text into the input field (see screenshot below), and click **Start execution**. Note the version of the dataset that we are using for training, as denoted by the "DataDate" parameter:
```
{
  "instances": [
    {
      "start": "2019-07-03",
      "target": [
        120
      ]
    }
  ],
  "configuration": {
    "num_samples": 5,
    "output_types": [
      "mean",
      "quantiles",
      "samples"
    ],
    "quantiles": [
      "0.5",
      "0.9"
    ]
  }
}
```
